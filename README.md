# GitHub Emoji Viewer

Searching for a way to spice up your commits? Want to add some individuality to your open-source contributions? Look no further!
This simple web application pulls and displays all of the available GitHub emoji.

## Getting started:
(NOTE: Begin with Step 3 if you are viewing from GitHub pages.)

1. Clone the GitHub repository (or download an archive) and open the corresponding folder.
2. Open the "index.html" file in your browser of choice.
3. Press the "View emoji" button, and voila! You will be presented with every emoji currently available on GitHub.
4. To view the code used to display a specific emoji, find it on the page and hover your mouse over it. The displayed tooltip will correspond to the GitHub code used to insert this emoji.
- Example format:  
The corresponding code for the ":mag_right:" emoji is ": mag_right :" (without spaces!)
5. Simply add your chosen emoji's corresponding code to your next commit, push, and enjoy your shiny new commit (now with emoji)!

## Brief:

This project functions by contacting the GitHub API and pulling a .json formatted list of all currently available emojis. For each returned emoji, the icon is displayed neatly using a .css stylesheet.  
Sounds lovely, right? Try it for yourself!
